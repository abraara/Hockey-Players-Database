# Hockey Players

Hockey Players is a fully responsive website designed to view information about players in the NHL. The website is built using PHP and MySQL, making it dynamic and interactive, while bootstrap css provides an attractive and user-friendly design. jQuery is used to enhance the website's functionality by providing various features, including filtering and searching. MySQL is used to pull data to the site to allow admin users to create, edit, and delete players. This project was created by scratch from me during my tenure at NAIT.
